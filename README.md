# Reading---Serverless_Functions

- **Serverless functions** are cloud-based, event-driven functions that allow developers to execute code without the need to manage or provision servers. This architecture abstracts server management tasks, enabling developers to focus purely on writing code that performs specific tasks. Serverless functions are typically small, stateless, and execute in response to events such as HTTP requests, database changes, or messaging queue activities.

- **Vercel** is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It is known for its ease of use, performance, and integration capabilities. Vercel provides tools to build, deploy, and manage web applications with minimal configuration. It supports a wide range of frameworks and languages, making it a popular choice for modern web development.

- **HTTP request methods** are used to perform actions on resources identified by URLs. Common methods include:

GET: Retrieve data from a server.
POST: Submit data to a server.
PUT: Update a resource on a server.
DELETE: Remove a resource from a server.
PATCH: Partially update a resource on a server.
